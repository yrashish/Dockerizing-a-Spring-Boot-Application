# Introduction

Containerization has revolutionized the way modern applications are deployed and managed. Docker, one of the most widely used containerization technologies, simplifies application deployment by packaging an application and its dependencies into a single image that can run on any platform. This blog post will explore how to use Docker to containerize a Spring Boot application, a popular Java framework for building web applications, microservices, and APIs. We will dive into the benefits of containerizing a Spring Boot application and provide a comprehensive guide to creating a Docker image that can be easily deployed to any environment. By the end of this post, readers will have the knowledge and tools necessary to containerize their Spring Boot applications and take advantage of the many benefits of containerization.
